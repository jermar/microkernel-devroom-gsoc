			<h1>Community Guidelines &mdash; Microkernel Devroom and Google Summer of Code 2017</h1>
			
			<p>On this page, we provide tips for contributors to microkernel-based operating
			system projects under the umbrella of the <a href="http://gsoc.microkernel.info/">Microkernel
			devroom</a>. The tips are based on previous experience in this area. For official guidance,
			please consult your mentor.</p>
			
			<h2>Interacting with the Community</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The open source community can provide invaluable feedback to
					your ideas so make sure to interact with the community effectively.
					Simply put, participate actively on mailing lists, forums, chats
					and other communication channels.</li>
				<li>Prefer open communication on the mailing lists, forums and chats
					over one-to-one private communication of any sort.</li>
				<li>Don't be shy, other people don't bite.</li>
				<li>Nobody's perfect.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Implementation</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Do not impose artificial limits on your implementation. For example,
					if your project is fundamentally platform-neutral, e.g. it is
					a&nbsp;sophisticated data structure or a&nbsp;new file system, do not
					restrict the implementation to a single supported processor
					architecture, byte order or word width.</li>
				<li>Stick to the coding style of the existing code and to the official coding
					style defined by the project you are contributing to. Your failure to adhere
					to the given coding style requires someone else's extra work to perform
					the cleanup after you.</li>
				<li>Adhere to good coding practices, such as adequate commenting, avoiding
					dense code, using horizontal spacing as visual delimiters and keeping
					the block nesting level under control. Also pay attention to seemingly
					subtle and unimportant decisions, such as proper naming of identifiers,
					following a coherent naming pattern, etc. Remember that the code is
					written once, but read many times. Do not make it harder for the reader
					than it is strictly necessary.</li>
				<li>When using third-party code, always give credit where the credit is due
					and always follow the license of the third-party code.</li>
			</ul>
