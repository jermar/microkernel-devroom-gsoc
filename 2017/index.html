			<h1>Microkernel Devroom and Google Summer of Code 2017</h1>
			
			<blockquote>Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on
			introducing students to open source software development. Students
			work on a&nbsp;3&nbsp;month programming project with an open source
			organization during their break from university. Since its inception
			in 2005, the program has brought together 12,000+ student participants
			and 11,000 mentors from over 118 countries worldwide. Google Summer of
			Code has produced 30,000,000+ lines of code for 568 open source
			organizations.</blockquote>

			<h2>Microkernel Devroom</h2>
			
			<p>We are a&nbsp;confederation of free software and open source projects
			that promote the ideas of <a href="http://www.microkernel.info/">microkernel-based
			operating systems</a>. We want to extend our previous cooperation in
			<a href="https://fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a>'s
			<a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/track/microkernels_and_component_based_os/">Microkernel devroom</a>
			(that has been organized in turn by one of the open source microkernel
			projects since 2012) into the realm of Google Summer of Code.</p>
			
			<p>Projects participating this year:</p>
			
			<ul>
			<li><a href="#genode">Genode</a>
			<li><a href="#helenos">HelenOS</a>
			<li><a href="#hurd">GNU Hurd</a>
			<li><a href="#minix3">MINIX 3</a>
			<li><a href="#redox">Redox</a>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Who Are We Looking for?</h2>
			
			<p>We are looking for students with real interest in operating systems
			(especially microkernel-based operating systems), system-level
			programming and software design. We are looking for people who will play
			nicely with our community and by our <a href="./guidelines.html">guidelines</a>.
			We are looking for those who are willing to give their project the
			necessary time and care. If a&nbsp;student only wants to pass Google
			Summer of Code with the minimum effort, our organization is not
			a&nbsp;good match for him or her. We are looking for already
			experienced coders (although specific experience with microkernel-based
			operating systems is not necessary) because most of our projects start at
			the medium difficulty level and the code itself is not trivial. The successful
			candidate should be a good communicator, too.</p>
			
			<p>We would like to invite prospective students to demonstrate their
			abilities and determination to work on a&nbsp;microkernel-based
			operating system during the Google Summer of Code 2017 by completing
			a&nbsp;simple task before the student application deadline on April 3rd
			2017. The student should check out the sources of a&nbsp;microkernel-based
			operating system represented by our organization (see the list below),
			build the system, then either pick an existing bug or enhancement or
			think of their own improvement, implement it, test it and submit the
			patch to the developers. Note that the exact means of submitting the
			patch differs from one project to another. Do not hesitate to introduce
			yourself and your intentions to the core developers of the given
			microkernel-based operating system and ask for initial guidance (see the
			links below).</p>
			
			<p>Students interested in applying for a&nbsp;Google Summer of Code
			project also need to fill out the <a href="./form.html">application
			form</a> and attach it to their application.</p>
			
			<p>If a&nbsp;student is accepted, he or she will be invited to
			participate in the community of the given microkernel-based operating
			system project from day one. The community will also ask him or her to
			periodically document his or her progress via email write-ups and/or blog
			entries. The mentor will act as a&nbsp;buddy in the core development team
			who will monitor the development and provide the student with guidance
			when necessary. However, as a first-class member of the development community
			the student will also receive feedback from other developers besides the
			designated mentor.</p>
			
			<h2>Ideas List</h2>
			
			<p>The project ideas for the Google Summer of Code in the context of the
			Microkernel devroom are divided primarily by the microkernel-based operating
			system the student wants to contribute to. The ideas can be characterized as
			things that will improve the usability of the given microkernel-based operating
			system while building on the functionality already present in the code base.
			No project in the list poses an open-questions topic in the academic sense.
			Instead, each project is rather implementation-oriented. We expect the students
			to deliver code that could be seamlessly integrated with the existing
			code base. However, note that the extent of some of the ideas listed below
			needs to be scaled down (e.g. implementing only the essential parts)
			in order to be achievable in one trimester.</p>
			
			<p>Note that contributing to a&nbsp;microkernel-based operating system does
			<strong>not</strong> have to involve kernel programming. In
			a&nbsp;microkernel-based operating system, most of the features involve
			work on the user space parts of the system, such as libraries and server
			tasks. Having said that, we do not object pure kernel projects either.</p>
			
			<p>The Ideas List should be understood just as a&nbsp;small subset of all
			possible topics. If you do not see an appealing topic on this list, you
			might want to consider talking to the core developers of the given
			microkernel-based operating system about your own ideas. Remember that the
			ideas are not set in stone and, after all, it is the student who is going
			to propose the project to the core developers.</p>
			
			<h3 id="genode"><a href="http://genode.org/">Genode</a></h3>
			
			<p>Genode is a&nbsp;tool kit for building highly secure special-purpose
			operating systems. It scales from embedded systems with as little as
			4&nbsp;MB of memory to highly dynamic general-purpose workloads.</p>

			<h3 id="helenos"><a href="http://www.helenos.org/">HelenOS</a></h3>
			
			<p>HelenOS is a&nbsp;portable microkernel-based multiserver operating
			system designed and implemented from scratch. It decomposes key operating
			system functionality such as file systems, networking, device drivers and
			graphical user interface into a&nbsp;collection of fine-grained user space
			components that interact with each other via message passing.</p>
			
			<p>HelenOS maintains its own <a href="http://www.helenos.org/gsoc2017">GSoC page</a>.
						
			
			<h3 id="hurd"><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/">GNU Hurd</a></h3>
			
			<p>The GNU Hurd is the GNU project's replacement for the Unix kernel.
			It is a collection of servers that run on the Mach microkernel to implement
			file systems, network protocols, file access control, and other features that
			are implemented by the Unix kernel or similar kernels (such as Linux).</p>
			
			<p>The Hurd project maintains its GSoC ideas in a
			<a href="http://darnassus.sceen.net/~hurd-web/community/gsoc/project_ideas/">separate
			page</a>. Contact <a href="mailto:bug-hurd@gnu.org">bug-hurd@gnu.org</a> for more information.</p>
			
			<h3 id="minix3"><a href="http://www.minix3.org/">MINIX 3</a></h3>
			
			<p>MINIX&nbsp;3 is a&nbsp;free, open-source, operating system designed to
			be highly reliable, flexible, and secure. It is based on a tiny microkernel
			running in kernel mode with the rest of the operating system running as
			a&nbsp;number of isolated, protected, processes in user mode.</p>
			
			<p>MINIX 3 maintains its own <a href="http://wiki.minix3.org/doku.php?id=soc:2017:start">ideas page</a>.
			Please contact the <a href="http://wiki.minix3.org/doku.php?id=howtocontribute">MINIX 3 community</a>
			for more information.</p>
			
			<h3 id="redox"><a href="https://www.redox-os.org/">Redox</a></h3>
			
			<p>Redox is a&nbsp;Unix-like operating system written in Rust, aiming
			to bring the innovations of Rust to a&nbsp;modern microkernel and full
			set of applications. Redox isn't afraid of dropping the bad parts of
			POSIX, while preserving modest Linux API compatibility.</p>
			
			<p>For a&nbsp;more detailed description of the ideas please contact
			the <a href="https://github.com/redox-os/redox/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Redox
			community</a>.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Building Redox on Redox</li>
				<li>Get rid of SYS_PIPE2 (and possibly other syscalls)</li>
				<li>Automated unit &amp; integration tests</li>
				<li>Move scheme management out of the kernel</li>
				<li>Move option processing from utilities to scheme implementations</li>
			</ul>
