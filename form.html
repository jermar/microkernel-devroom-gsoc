		  <div class="intro">
			<blockquote>Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on
			introducing students to open source software development. Students
			work on a&nbsp;3&nbsp;month programming project with an open source
			organization during their break from university. Since its inception
			in 2005, the program has brought together 13,000+ student participants
			and 12,000 mentors from over 125 countries worldwide. Google Summer of
			Code has produced 33,000,000+ lines of code for 608 open source
			organizations.</blockquote>
