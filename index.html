		  <div class="intro">
			<blockquote>Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on
			introducing students to open source software development. Students
			work on a&nbsp;3&nbsp;month programming project with an open source
			organization during their break from university. Since its inception
			in 2005, the program has brought together 13,000+ student participants
			and 12,000 mentors from over 125 countries worldwide. Google Summer of
			Code has produced 33,000,000+ lines of code for 608 open source
			organizations.</blockquote>

			<h2>Welcome!</h2>
			
			<p>We are a&nbsp;confederation of free software and open source projects
			that promote the ideas of <a href="http://www.microkernel.info/">microkernel-based
			operating systems</a>. <a href="/2017">Last year</a> we successfully extended our previous cooperation from
			<a href="https://fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a>'s
			<a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/track/microkernels/">Microkernel devroom</a>
			into the realm of Google Summer of Code.</p>
			
			<p>So far, the following projects have signed up for this year:</p>
			
			<ul>
			<li><a href="#helenos">HelenOS</a>
			<li><a href="#l4re">L4Re</a>
			<li><a href="#minix3">MINIX 3</a>
			<li><a href="#redox">Redox</a>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Who Are We Looking for?</h2>
			
			<p>
			We are looking for <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules/">eligible students</a>
			with genuine interest in operating systems (especially microkernel-based operating systems),
			system-level programming and software design. If you recognize yourself in that description,
			here are some <a href="./guidelines.html">guidelines</a> to follow when interacting with our
			communities and working on our project ideas.</p>
			
			<p>We would like to invite prospective students to demonstrate their
			abilities and determination to work on a&nbsp;microkernel-based
			operating system during the Google Summer of Code 2018 by completing
			a&nbsp;small programming task before the student application deadline
			on April 23rd 2018. The students should check with the individual projects
			for their specific requirements.</p>
			
			<p>Students interested in applying for a&nbsp;Google Summer of Code
			project also need to fill out the <a href="./form.html">application
			form</a> and attach it to their application. Without this form,
			the application cannot considered.</p>
			
			<h2>Ideas List</h2>
			
			<p>The project ideas for the Google Summer of Code in the context of the
			Microkernel devroom are divided primarily by the microkernel-based operating
			system the student wants to contribute to. Here we provide just a summary
			of ideas for each project and link to each project's Ideas page which contains
			more details.</p>
			
			<p>The Ideas List should be understood just as a&nbsp;small subset of all
			possible topics. If you do not see an appealing topic on this list, you
			might want to consider talking to the core developers of the given
			microkernel-based operating system about your own ideas. Remember that the
			ideas are not set in stone and, after all, it is the student who is going
			to propose the project to the core developers.</p>

			<p>HelenOS is a&nbsp;portable microkernel-based multiserver operating
			system designed and implemented from scratch. It decomposes key operating
			system functionality such as file systems, networking, device drivers and
			graphical user interface into a&nbsp;collection of fine-grained user space
			components that interact with each other via message passing.</p>

			The L4Re Runtime Environment is an operating system framework for building
			systems with real-time, security, safety and virtualization requirements.
			It consists of the L4Re hypervisor/kernel and a user-level infrastructure
			that includes basic services such as program loading and memory management.
			L4Re also provides the environment for applications, including libraries
			and process local functionality.

			<p>MINIX&nbsp;3 is a&nbsp;free, open-source, operating system designed to
			be highly reliable, flexible, and secure. It is based on a tiny microkernel
			running in kernel mode with the rest of the operating system running as
			a&nbsp;number of isolated, protected, processes in user mode.</p>

			<p>Redox is a&nbsp;Unix-like operating system written in Rust, aiming
			to bring the innovations of Rust to a&nbsp;modern microkernel and full
			set of applications. Redox isn't afraid of dropping the bad parts of
			POSIX, while preserving modest Linux API compatibility.</p>
